## 1. Main Question

- What problem is the paper trying to solve? (1–2 sentences)
  - Physical attack on non-static object like person's T-shirt that could undergo deformation.

## 2. Key Method

- One-line description of the main attack/defense.
- Use glossary terms when possible (e.g., “FGSM = adds noise along gradient sign”).
  - Physical attack, Adversarial T-shirt: advT-Affine, advT-TPS
  - Train on deformation of T-shirt to maximize loss even with moving T-shirt

## 3. Main Results

- One key experiment (dataset + outcome).
- Quote numbers if easy (e.g., “Error reduced from 0.94% → 0.84% on MNIST”).
  - 74% on digital and 57% on physical. Previous work: 18% on physical.

## 4. Strengths & Limitations

- 1 bullet strength (e.g., “Simple and reproducible”).
  - High success rate, attack on moving deforming object
- 1 bullet limitation (e.g., “Only tested on images, white-box only”).

## 5. Applications / Relevance

- If any — real-world link, or why it matters for other research.
  - Evade real world person detector / surveillance

## 6. Self-Check

- **2-minute explanation**: Could you explain this to a classmate? Write 2–3 plain sentences.
  - Attack on person detector AI using an intentional pattern on T-shirt that makes the person undetectable.
- **Unknown terms**: List any jargon you didn’t fully get (e.g., “maxout network,” “universal approximator theorem”).
  - TPS-based transformer
