## 1. Main Question

- What problem is the paper trying to solve? (1–2 sentences)
	- Adversarial example exists

## 2. Key Method

- One-line description of the main attack/defense.
	- Small perturbation added that is segmentally same to human eye looks different to AI 
- Use glossary terms when possible (e.g., “FGSM = adds noise along gradient sign”).

## 3. Main Results

- One key experiment (dataset + outcome).
- Quote numbers if easy (e.g., “Error reduced from 0.94% → 0.84% on MNIST”).

## 4. Strengths & Limitations

- 1 bullet strength (e.g., “Simple and reproducible”).
- 1 bullet limitation (e.g., “Only tested on images, white-box only”).

## 5. Applications / Relevance

- If any — real-world link, or why it matters for other research.

## 6. Self-Check

- **2-minute explanation**: Could you explain this to a classmate? Write 2–3 plain sentences.
	- There seems to be a thing we call adversarial example where small perturbation can change the output of AI. How does this happen when AI can generalize on a problem to obtain semantic meaning?
- **Unknown terms**: List any jargon you didn’t fully get (e.g., “maxout network,” “universal approximator theorem”).
