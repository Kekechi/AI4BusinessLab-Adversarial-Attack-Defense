# ðŸ“‚ Data

This directory contains all machine-readable tagging data.

- **mapping.csv** â†’ Spreadsheet-friendly dataset (exported from Google Sheets).
- **mapping.json** â†’ Compiled master dataset (machine-readable).
- **json_group/** â†’ Curated JSON files (approved, compiled into `mapping.json`).
- **json_individual/** â†’ Individual JSON files, organized by contributor.

ðŸ‘‰ Workflow:

1. Each member tags papers and saves their JSON under `json_individual/<name>/`.
2. During curation, agreed versions are copied into `json_group/`.
3. Run `scripts/compile_json.py` to rebuild `mapping.json`.
