# ðŸ“‚ Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experiments in adversarial ML.

- **group/** â†’ Canonical, curated notebooks (clean, fast to run).
- **individual/** â†’ Personal experimentation notebooks, organized by contributor.

ðŸ‘‰ Typical progression:

1. Each member implements/experiments in their own folder.
2. After review, the most polished version is copied into `group/`.
